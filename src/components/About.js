        Originally, I was attracted to the eyelash extension industry because I
        love the way lashes look, as you would expect. To my surprise, there was
        a deeper rewarding feeling to every set I applied. It was the look my
        clients gave every time I handed them the mirror after an application.
        As if they had never truly seen the beauty in their eyes before.
        Countless times I've heard, "How have I not done this earlier?!"

        One of the many benefits of having eyelash extensions is the time saved
        in the morning when you are getting ready. Giving yourself more time to
        sleep in, make a cup of coffee or beat the traffic in the morning can
        really set your day off in the right direction. Mostly, it makes me
        happy to see women giving themselves a couple hours out of their day to
        feel beautiful.
